Hello, this is my landing page about bicycles.

I like riding bicycles in life, so I also turned my interest from life into code.

I used a semantic layout in this project and followed to pixel perfect. Also, I split the sccs code into blocks for better readability and to make my code easier to maintain.

Here you can check, what I've made ===> [DEMO LINK](https://sintax1s.github.io/MyBike_Landing/)
